# Tmux config file

- fork from [here](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)

### How to use

Just copy the file file to `HOME` dir and rename them with a `.` prefix.

```bash
mv tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
mv tmux.conf.local ~/.tmux.conf.local
```

Anything you want to change, you better do that in the `.tmux.conf.local` file.





### tip

Already set the `C-a` as a prefix.

if you want to use the system clipboard together, you should install `xsel` or `xclip`.

`prefix + m` to enable/disable the mouse mode.

### update

Add the `vimrc` file recently used. And if you want to make it work, you need to download the [gruvbox.vim](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
